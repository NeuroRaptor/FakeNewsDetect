## 📦 Overview

This repository contains the **Flask web application** that serves a trained **Fake News Detection** model. The app allows users to input a news headline or article and classifies it as **Real** or **Fake** using a machine learning model.

The app loads:
- A pre-trained **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model
- A **TF-IDF vectorizer** for transforming input text

Both artifacts were developed in the model training repo linked below.

## 🔗 Model Training Repository

The machine learning model used in this app was developed, trained, and evaluated in a separate repository:

➡️ [`Fake-News-Detection`](https://github.com/NeuroRaptor/Fake-News-Detection)

That repo includes:
- EDA and preprocessing with NLP (NLTK)
- Comparison of models: SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, CNN, LSTM, BERT
- Model performance analysis (Accuracy, F1 Score)
- Export of final SVM model and TF-IDF vectorizer

The exported files used here:
- `models/svm_text_model.pkl`
- `models/tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

```
FakeNewsDetect/
├── models/
│   ├── svm_text_model.pkl        # Trained SVM model
│   └── tfidf_vectorizer.pkl      # TF-IDF vectorizer
├── templates/
│   └── index.html                # HTML form for input
├── app.py                        # Flask app entry point
├── requirements.txt              # Dependencies
├── .gitignore
└── venv/                         # Virtual environment (optional)
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User submits a news article via web interface
2. Text is vectorized using `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`
3. Vector is passed to `svm_text_model.pkl` for prediction
4. Output is displayed as "Real" or "Fake"

## 🖥️ Run the App Locally

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NeuroRaptor/FakeNewsDetect.git
cd FakeNewsDetect
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (Optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Flask app
```bash
python app.py
```

### 5. Visit in browser
